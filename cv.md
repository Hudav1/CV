#### About Me

I graduated from college as a programmer, I barely managed to finish my studies, it was hard because it was difficult and it seemed like I could have gained more knowledge through self-study.

I strive to become a full-fledged programmer and earn money from it, plus you sit almost all the time and press buttons on the keyboard. And I love it.

No work experience.
